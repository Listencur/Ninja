    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">My name is Justin Sun / å­™çƒ¨é˜³</h2>
    <p>
      I am a frontend developer with a passion for
      <Link href="https://github.com/jsun969">open source</Link>
      currently based in Shanghai. I like to implement my ideas in code and find
      the best solution in solving various problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use
      <Link href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</Link>
      as my code editor and like to use
      <Link href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</Link>
      and
      <Link href="https://reactjs.org/">React</Link>
      for web development. Besides that, I can use many other cutting-edge technology
      stacks in projects. For instance, I used
      <Link href="https://astro.build/">Astro</Link>
      for this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides programming, I like playing video games like
      <Link href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</Link>
      and
      <Link href="https://dead-cells.com/">Dead Cells</Link>
      . But I am not good at FPS games. Feel free to suggest various games to me
      and hope to play with you!
